Feature: Upload Rules
	In order to enforce rules for entitlements
	As a Candlepin
	I want to be able to upload rules and get the current rule set

# TODO: Re-enable once we have proper permissions support
#   	Scenario: Rules are Downloaded
#        Given I am a consumer "Somebox"
#        When I Download Rules
#        Then I Have Rules

#      Scenario: Rules are Uploaded
#        Given I am a consumer "Somebox"
#        And I Download Original Rules
#        And I have ruleset "ffffffffffffffffffffffff"
#        When I Upload Ruleset
#        Then I Have Rules
#        And I Upload Original Rules
